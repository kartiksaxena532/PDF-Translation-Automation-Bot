[Detailed description of the invention]

【0001】

[Technical Field to which the Invention Belongs]

The present invention relates generally to radio antennas, and more particularly to internal multi-band antennas used in portable communication devices such as mobile phones.

【0002】

[Prior art and problems to be solved by the invention]

(1) The development of miniature antennas for mobile phones has received much attention recently due to the miniaturization of mobile phones, the need to keep the amount of radio frequency (RF) power absorbed by users below a certain level regardless of the size of the mobile phone, and the adoption of multimode phones. It is useful, desirable, and even necessary to provide multiband antennas mounted inside the mobile phone body, and these antennas should be capable of operating within multiple systems such as E-GSM900 (880 MHz to 960 MHz), GSM1800 (1710 MHz to 1880 MHz), PCS1900 (859 MHz to 1990 MHz), and UMTS (1900 MHz to 2170 MHz). Shorted patch antennas or planar inverted-F antennas (PIFAs) have been used to provide two or more resonant frequencies. For example, Liu et al. disclose a dual-band PIFA (see Non-Patent Document 1), Pankinaho discloses a dual-resonance antenna structure for several frequency ranges that can be used as an internal antenna for a mobile phone (see Patent Document 1), Isohata et al. disclose a planar antenna with a relatively low specific absorption rate (SAR) value (see Patent Document 2), and Song et al. disclose a triple-band PIFA (see Non-Patent Document 2). Since mobile phones capable of operating at UMTS frequencies will become a reality in the near future, it is useful and desirable to provide an antenna structure that can operate at UMTS frequencies as well as GSM frequencies.

[Embodiment of the invention]

The invention will become apparent from the description when read in conjunction with Figures 1-3(a) and (b).

FIG. 1 illustrates a radiating element of a multiband antenna structure 1 according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown in the figure, the antenna structure 1 includes a sub-antenna structure 10 having a short-circuit plane 5, a first radiating element 20, a third radiating element 30, and a third radiating element 40. In the sub-antenna structure 10, the first radiating element 20 is a substantially planar electrical connection element having a first end 22 for shorting the first radiating element 20 to the short-circuit plane 5 at a short-circuit point G1. Thus, the first radiating element 20 is a short-circuit patch having a first resonant frequency. Preferably, the first resonant frequency is substantially in the range of 1710 MHz to 1880 MHz. A feed line 24 is provided adjacent to the first end 22 to feed the first radiating element 20. The second radiating element 30 is a substantially flat, strip-shaped conductive region surrounding the first radiating element 20, with a gap 34 therebetween. The second radiating element 30 has a second end 32. The second end 32 is connected to the first end 22 of the first radiating element 20 to short-circuit the second radiating element 30. Thus, the second radiating element 30 becomes a short-circuit patch while simultaneously allowing the second radiating element 30 to share the feed line 24 for power supply. The third radiating element 40 is physically separated from the structure 10 except for their connection through the shorting plane. As shown in the figure, the third radiating element 40 is a substantially planar conductive element having a third end 42 connected to the shorting plane 5 to short-circuit the third radiating element 40 to the shorting plane 5 at shorting point G2. Thus, the third radiating element 40 is also a short-circuit patch. Adjacent to the third end 42, a feed line 50 is provided to feed the third radiating element 40.

【0015】

As shown in Figure 1, all of the radiating elements 20, 30, 40 are disposed substantially in a common plane. However, it is possible that only two of the radiating elements 20, 30, 40 are disposed in the same plane, or that each of them is disposed in a different plane. Furthermore, one or more of these radiating elements may be folded so that the folded elements are disposed in different planes.

JP 4102147 B2 2008.6.18

The feed lines 24, 50 are shown passing through the shorting plane 5 via openings A1, A2 to connect to their respective radio frequency modules. However, it is not necessary for the feed lines 24, 50 to pass through the shorting plane and thus reach the radio frequency modules.

【0016】

As shown in FIG. 2, the feed line 24 is connected to the radio frequency module 70 for power supply, while the feed line 50 is connected to the radio frequency module 72 for power supply. A switching device 60 is connected between the feed line 24 and the shorting plane 5, and a switching device 62 is connected between the feed line 50 and the shorting plane 5. Each of the switching devices 60, 62 can be operated to an open or closed position. As shown in FIG. 3(a), the switching device 60 is operated to an open position to enable power supply of the feed line 24 between the radio frequency module 70 and the sub-antenna structure 10, while the switching device 62 is operated to a closed position, thereby shorting the feed line 50 to the shorting plane 5. When the switching devices 60, 62 are in these positions, the second radiating element 30 has a second resonant frequency substantially lower than the first resonant frequency, and the third radiating element 40 has a third resonant frequency generally higher than the first resonant frequency. Preferably, the second resonant frequency is substantially in the range of 880 MHz to 960 MHz, and the third resonant frequency is substantially in the range of 1850 MHz to 1990 MHz. However, when the switching device 62 is operated to the open position to enable power supply through the power supply line 50 between the radio frequency module 72 and the third radiating element 40, and the switching device 60 is operated to the closed position, thereby shorting the power supply line 24 to the shorting plane 5, the third radiating element 40 has a fourth resonant frequency generally higher than the third resonant frequency, and the first radiating element 20 has a fifth resonant frequency substantially equal to the third resonant frequency. Preferably, the fifth resonant frequency is substantially in the range of 1920 MHz to 2170 MHz.

【0017】

The switching devices 60, 62 may be PIN diodes, FET switches, MEMS switches, or

may be a solid-state switch.

【0018】

According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, all of the conductive regions that make up the radiating elements of the antenna structure may be disposed on a common plane, although they may be disposed on different planes. The antenna structure may be made more compact by using narrow strips of conductive regions with serpentine patterns in two or three dimensions. Furthermore, it is not necessary for radiating element 30 to surround radiating element 20, as shown in FIG. 1.

【0019】

The invention is disclosed in relation to GSM and UMTS. However, the resonant frequency can be made higher or lower by changing the dimensions and geometry of one or more of the radiating elements. For example, it is possible to use the same antenna for short-range wireless connections (such as Bluetooth®).

【0020】

The multi-band wireless antenna of the present invention is suitable for use in mobile phones, personal digital assistant (PDA) devices,

Or it can be used in electronic devices such as portable computers.

【0021】

Thus, while the present invention has been described with respect to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing and various other changes, omissions and deviations in form and detail thereof may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.

【0022】

[Effect of the invention]

The internal multi-band antenna of the present invention is capable of operating at multiple frequencies, providing a mobile phone antenna that can operate at UMTS frequencies as well as GSM frequencies.
